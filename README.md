üß© Terraform Module Breakdown
## The project follows a modular Terraform structure, organized into the following reusable modules:

# module/network
VPC

Public and private subnets

Internet gateway

Route tables

# module/security
Security groups for Beanstalk and RDS

# module/s3
S3 buckets for:

Code deployment

Versioning

Lifecycle management

S3 access policies

# module/iam
IAM roles and instance profiles

Policies for EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk

# module/rds
PostgreSQL database instance

Subnet group

Parameter group

# module/elasticbeanstalk
Elastic Beanstalk Application

Environment with:

Solution stack configuration

Load balancer settings

Environment variables

CloudWatch log streaming

Rolling deployment policy

## üöÄ AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment
Steps Handled by Terraform:
Creates an S3 bucket for application deployment artifacts.

Defines IAM roles and instance profiles used by Elastic Beanstalk.

Creates a VPC, subnets, and networking components.

Deploys an RDS instance in a private subnet.

Sets up security groups for secure access and internal traffic.

Provisions Elastic Beanstalk:

Defines the application.

Creates the environment with load balancing, autoscaling, and logging.

Uses rolling deployments for zero downtime.
